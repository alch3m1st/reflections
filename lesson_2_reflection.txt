What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- It creates an empty git repository (the .git folder which contains repository metadata)
- It makes no commit for you.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

- Working directory is the file contents of the folder housing the repository
- Staging area is the area where you collect the files you want to be in your next commit
- Repository is the historical commits of the files inside your working directory, plus your working directory.

change?
